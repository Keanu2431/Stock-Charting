Lumpkin's Charts

For this project I wanted to create something to help me practice and display my knowledge on the intricacies of OOP,APIs,Asynchronus Functions,Working With Libraries and Using Mathematical Algorythms alongside the Procedural Paradigm of programming.

I used classes to encapsulate my important functions in order to create something similar to a module.

The fetch API was used to make HTTP calls followed by chaining promises and a series of methods to extract only the needed data returned from the request.

In order for the project to work without major error I had to catch errors and apply if statements to make sure each potential error would be handled properly allowing the application to flow smoothly.

For this project I had to find a suitable library for the visual aspects of my application and find a REST API that would be easy to work with to get the data, for that I went with JSCharting and Alphavantage.co
